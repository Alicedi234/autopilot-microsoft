Autopilot+ creates AI clones to automate tasks in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams)

Each clone is trained based on user instructions and preferences

Autopilot+ is designed to supplement, not replace, human work

By automating tedious tasks, it frees up time for creative and fulfilling activities that require human traits like empathy and decision-making
